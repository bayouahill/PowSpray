         <p class="box grabber"> Skiing, there truly isn't anything like it. The cold wind hitting your face. The feeling of riding in 2 feet of fluffy powder. The way it flies into your face. The feeling of finally landing that trick you spent all afternoon attempting. If your going to become addicted to anything, become addicted to skiing.</p><br>
         <p class="box grabber"> As a snowboarder I dream everyday about finding that one line that was sent from heaven. A line that has two feet of fresh powder underneath bright blue skies. This feeling is truly unlike anything out there, and I'm convinced that it can cure any sickness or disease.</p><br>

                <ul class="box">
                    <li id="skisty"><span class="bold">Skiing Styles:</span> There are three different ski styles; freeriding/backcountry, park, and cross-country. Freeriding/backcountry is what you usually think of when you see skiing pictures or videos. People usually climb crazy mountains to find the best snow and lines to ski. It also can come by simply going into areas of a ski resort that have deemed it "backcountry." Usually this means that there are cliffs and rocks that are present and combined with a steep incline make skiing these areas very dangerous. Park skiing is simply skiers that use any combination of rails, boxes, jump, or any other object they can to do tricks with. Then cross-country is similar to snowshoeing, but with skis. This type of skiing is done more for leisure than sport.
                    </li><br>
                    <li id="shape"><span class="bold">Ski Shapes:</span> Like the different skiing types there are three main shapes to skis. They are; powder, all-mountain, and cross-country. The names are pretty straight forward for the activity. While you can argue there are more shapes or styles, they usually have to do with specific equipment or how they are tuned. Powder skis are longer and wider allowing you to have more surface area on top of the snow. In a sense it's like you have two mini snowboards on you feet. All-mountain skis aren't as wide and are just a bit shorter. Although the length of your skis is all dependent on your skill level. </li><br>

                    <li id="boardsty"><span class="bold">Snowboarding Styles:</span> Unlike skiing there are only two styles of snowboarding. There's freeriding and all-mountain. Freeriding is just like skiing in the sense of where you ski. Although compared to skiers they can use their normal equipment, where as snowboarders need different equipment from their normal gear. All-mountain is everything inbounds at a ski resort. In this category you have park riding and the normal leisure riding on groomers.  </li><br>
                    <li id="camber"><span class="bold">Board Cambers:</span> The camber of the board can determine a lot of things. There are so many different types of cambers and some companies have their own too. A few notable camber types are the directional camber, which is used for riding in powder. The bindings on this type of board are set more towards the back which allow for easier riding in powder. Then there are numerous variants on the traditional camber where you have the board touching towards the two ends. Depending on the style of ride you are seeking there are other camber types in this range which all have their own specialties. Then there are boards out there with no camber at all, but I would not recommend getting one of these.  </li><br>

            <li id="Top"><span class="bold subtitle box">Top Resorts</span><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li id="utah" class="box"><span class="bold listheading">Utah:</span>  Know as home to the "Greatest Snow on Earth" is home to some of the best resorts in the country and that is no joke. Utah is home to 15 resorts spanning from Beaver Mtn. up north, and Brian Head down in Cedar City in the south. In Salt Lake City area there are four world-class resorts that attract so many people there is a line from the resort to the mouth of the canyon. I have personally skied 10 out of the 15 resorts and while they were all great resorts, here are my personal favorite. 
                        <br>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="bold">Park City Mountain Resort:</span> Combined into a mega resort back in the winter of 2013. Prior to the merge were two resorts, The Canyons and Park City. If your looking for a place with some of the most terrain, short lines, runs for the whole family, or wanting the experience of backcountry this is the place for you.</li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Beaver Mountain:</span>  I grew up going to this resort. It's just outside of Logan Utah and offers quality runs and terrain all while being cheaper than 80% of the resorts throughout Utah. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Snowbird:</span> One of the ski resorts found just outside Salt Lake. They are know widely for their aerial tram, and their steep runs. Skiers from around the world come to Utah to ski Snowbird and hope they catch it on of of their majestic powder days. Downside to Snowbird is the lack of parking and the constant battle with avalanches that constantly close the canyons. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Snowbasin:</span> Located about an hour north of Salt Lake City, lays another world-class resort. Snowbasin is a good resort for when your too far to drive to Park City or the Cottonwoods. They held a few events in the 2002 Winter Olympics, and have a few runs to remind you of it. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Brighton:</span>  Located in the bigger of the Cottonwood canyons, lies another great resort. Unlike other resorts one notable factor is the amount of snowboarders. For years their neighbor, Solitude was a ski only resort. This drew all the attention to Brighton for boarders. They have great terrain and good runs, but a lack of lifts resulting in long lines and parking draws away from the over all experience. They also have a tendency to have to close areas and lifts due to wind. </li><br>
                            <ul class="ita"><span class="bold">Notable Resorts:</span> Deer Valley, Solitude, Alta and Sundance</ul> 
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <li id="rockies" class="box"><span class="bold listheading">The Rockies:</span> While I would love to be able to give you a detailed and personal account of each of these resorts. I have ranked the resorts in the rockies by the following criteria. First, where I want to go and ski and visit. Second, the quality of the resort and the terrain you can ski. <br>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="bold">Jackson Hole:</span> Set in the hills of the Tetons, lies a resort that is home some incredible terrain. While you can argue that some of the resorts below would beat this resort, there is just nothing like Jackson. Like Snowbird they have an aerial tram that draws a crowd and leads to some of the most intense runs you'll ever ski.
                            </li> <br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Sun Valley:</span> Sun Valley is know for more than their incredible skiing, they have a town that could rival some of the big name ski towns in Colorado. This is a resort that I don't know a whole lot about, but their partner resort, Snowbasin, is extremely similar. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Vail:</span> If your looking for a resort like Park City in Colorado, then Vail is your best bet. They own a dozen or more resorts throughout the world. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Steamboat:</span> Located in northern Colorado is a resort that draws lots of crowds. Located away from the cluster of resorts in central Colorado, you can expect to experience some top class skiing and terrain.</li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Big Sky:</span> A resort that is laid in the Montana mountains that draws crowds and skiers like no other. Other than my desire to ski there isn't much I know about this resort.</li><br>
                            <ul class="ita"><span class="bold"> Notable Resorts:</span> Aspen Snowmass, Breckenridge, Beaver Creek, Grand Targee, Keystone, and Telluride.</ul><br>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <li id="wc" class="box"><span class="bold listheading">West Coast:</span> Once again I have never been to any of these resorts but will rank them like I did with the resorts in the Rockies. Unlike the Rockies I know even less about these resorts and will just list some simple facts.  Due to my lack of knowledge I've only ranked three resorts. 
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="bold">Whistler Blackcomb :</span> Located in British Colombia in Canada, is home to a well known dual resort. Like Park City they have a surplus of runs and lifts. They hosted a majority of the snowsports events at the 2010 Winter Olympics. They have some exceptional terrain some of which could rival Snowbird. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Mammoth:</span> Resort located in California that is pretty widely know and draws lots of top skiers. Great train and a resort anyone would love to visit. </li><br>
                            <li><span class="bold">Heavenly:</span> One of the many resorts in the Lake Tahoe area is one resort that draws lots of attention. The Tahoe area has a feel to the Cottonwoods near Salt Lake which are home to Snowbird and Brighton. The snow isn't like Utah but the annual snowfall is excellent due to its location.</li><br>
                            <ul class="ita"><span class="bold">Notable Resorts:</span> Kirkwood, Northstar, Mt. Hood and Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows</ul><br>
